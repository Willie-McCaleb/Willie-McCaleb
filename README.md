Hi, I'm Dominik and I am a full-stack developer, who uses the MERN stack. Being a full-stack developer allows me to not only develop client-facing apps and websites but also develop them with cutting-edge backend support.

I specialize in building beautiful frontend development and I always make sure my backend can do the heavy lifting for your app or website. I love designing code that is light yet powerful, distributed yet synchronized, and beautiful yet effective.
